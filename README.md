# Secure_Contract_Protocol
# üîê Secure Digital Contract Exchange Simulator (Python)

This project simulates a secure property contract exchange between three parties ‚Äî a UK-based legal firm (Hackit & Run LLP), the seller‚Äôs solicitor, and the buyer (Mrs. Harvey). The exchange ensures confidentiality, authentication, and legal enforceability using modern cryptographic methods.

## üìå Project Overview

- This Python script demonstrates how a secure digital contract transaction can be implemented using:
  - **RSA** for key exchange and digital signatures
  - **AES-256** for encrypting contract data
  - **SHA-256** for hashing and integrity
  - **PBKDF2** for deriving secure AES keys from passwords

## üßë‚Äç‚öñÔ∏è Scenario

1. **Seller‚Äôs solicitor** drafts a contract and sends it to **H&R LLP**.
2. **H&R LLP** encrypts the contract using AES and sends it to **Mrs. Harvey**.
3. **Mrs. Harvey** decrypts the contract, digitally signs it, and sends it back.
4. **H&R LLP** verifies the signature and forwards the verified contract to the seller's solicitor.

This simulation mimics real-world legal requirements like those defined by the **UK Law of Property Act 1989**, **Electronic Communications Act 2000**, and **EU eIDAS regulation**.
